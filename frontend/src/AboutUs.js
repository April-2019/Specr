                    About SPECR...
                </h1>
                <p> SPECR is a webapp designed to help a user find the correct computer for their use-case scenario. What this means is that, while prices are displayed in order to give the user an accurate idea of comparison and research the concern of this webapp is to put the right computer to the person intending on purchasing it.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p> While finding the laptop with the most bang for the buck is important, what good is a computer that does not meet the minimum requirements for your tasks? Is that not it's own waste of money? As an example, AutoCAD and other AutoDesk applications that are widely used in various engineering fields requires a set of minimum specifications in order to run at all, and the recommended specifications are higher than the minimum 8GB of ram to run said programs. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>If you, the user. decide you want a faster computer, that is up to you! However, a Macbook Pro is overkill for the user intending to just go onto the internet and browse Facebook</p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Specs Explained... briefly</h1>
                <p>When buying a car, there are things the consumer looks for in order to make the best possible selection for their needs. If the consumer is a parent with 3 kids, one plays tuba, one plays football, and the third is the leader of the debate team, then an SUV may be the best solution. Easier to clean for when the football star is dirty, can fit a tuba for going back and forward from home/school. As well, they tend to be safer in an accident, so for the parent with three kids, the SUV is a great fit!</p>
                <p>But what of the single individual who just needs a commuter car? Well, an SUV might be nice, however maybe they want a coupe! After all, all they need is 2 doors and 4 wheels to get to work. If that consumer wanted to they could also get a fast coupe, that while it's a little faster than what they would need, they have the product that they desired and it accomplishes it's goals without a sweat, so long as this consumer takes care of this car, the car takes care of the computer.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>When purchasing a computer, it is important to think "What do I plan to do with this machine?" almost like buying a car. If all you plan to do is browse the web then maybe a Chrome Book would meet all of your needs  </p>
                <p>However if you are Programming, you may appreciate the versatility of a Mac computer! If you are in buisness, an Intel CPU is typically what is used in the industry today and is seen as more professional</p>
                <p>Ultimately the choice is yours. The goal of this application is to help you find the best computer for your uses so you do not end up with buyers remorse.</p>


                <h1>Specs Explained more in Depth</h1>
                <p>SPECR focuses on three core compnents of computer hardware, they are the</p>
                <li>Central Processing Unit, also known as the CPU</li>
                <li>Graphical Processing Unit, also known as the GPU</li>
                <li>Random Access Memory, referred to as RAM</li>
                <p>Think of the CPU as the engine to your computer. Without this essential part of your computer, nothing would work for you, and with an anemic engine you won't be getting very far, or getting there quickly. The better the CPU, the more "Horsepower" you could say the computer has</p>
                <p>The GPU can be compared to the interior of the car. This displays your computer signal to you through a screen. You need something to grab to operate the machine, that's a fact. Higher performance GPUS allow for a smother ride, and without one certain applications can feel very bumpy</p>
                <p>Your RAM determines how many things can be happening at once. The more RAM you have, the more that you can do. This INCLUDES your operating system, so lightweight operating systems such as Chrome OS can operate with less RAM. For Chromebooks, we recommend a minimum of 2GB of ram, and for a Windows computer we do not recommend a machine with less than 4 GB of ram.</p>
                <h2>What RAM is not</h2>
                <p>RAM is NOT storage. While they are both measured in GB, you should not get RAM GB values mixed up with how many gigabytes you have to save your documents and photos. If you need more storage, shop around for a computer with the storage you need. </p>
                <p>On the topic of storage, you may not need as much as you think. Typically an average user does not need more than 250-300 GB of storage. If you're intending on buying a gaming computer for gaming, disregard that number</p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>A Note on Workstations...</h1>
                <p>Workstations are typically computers with different specifications for different kinds of jobs. CPUs such as Intel Xeons and GPUs such as Nvidia Quadros are fantastic for workstation applications, but for buisness, school, gaming, and other standard applications they may not work for your use-case scenario. Remember, this is about finding the best fit for your needs, not about how much money you can spend</p>
                <p>While there are some worksation computers listed here, for extremely intense uses we recommend checking out a custom computer building company such as Puget Syetems. They build workstations for intense Content Creation, Engineering, and Scientific applications such as Machine Learning, AI, and Scientific Computing.
