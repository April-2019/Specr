                </h1>
                <p> SPECR is a webapp designed to help a user find the correct computer for their use-case scenario. What this means is that, while prices are displayed in order to give the user an accurate idea of comparison and research the concern of this webapp is to put the right computer to the person intending on purchasing it.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p> While finding the laptop with the most bang for the buck is important, what good is a computer that does not meet the minimum requirements for your tasks? Is that not it's own waste of money? As an example, AutoCAD and other AutoDesk applications that are widely used in various engineering fields requires a set of minimum specifications in order to run at all, and the recommended specifications are higher than the minimum 8GB of ram to run said programs. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>If you, the user. decide you want a faster computer, that is up to you! However, a Macbook Pro is overkill for the user intending to just go onto the internet and browse Facebook</p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Specs Explained... briefly</h1>
                <p>When buying a car, there are things the consumer looks for in order to make the best possible selection for their needs. If the consumer is a parent with 3 kids, one plays tuba, one plays football, and the third is the leader of the debate team, then an SUV may be the best solution. Easier to clean for when the football star is dirty, can fit a tuba for going back and forward from home/school. As well, they tend to be safer in an accident, so for the parent with three kids, the SUV is a great fit!</p>
                <p>But what of the single individual who just needs a commuter car? Well, an SUV might be nice, however maybe they want a coupe! After all, all they need is 2 doors and 4 wheels to get to work. If that consumer wanted to they could also get a fast coupe, that while it's a little faster than what they would need, they have the product that they desired and it accomplishes it's goals without a sweat, so long as this consumer takes care of this car, the car takes care of the computer.</p>
